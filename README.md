## Quick Start Template
- The file contains HTML and CSS - the presentation contains links to starter searches to help you learn them if you want to know more.
- The file does contain comments to help anyone tailoring it.
- The editing guidance is in the presentation and is largely focus on copying, pasting, and replacing.

## Conversion Script
- If you cannot download the VBS version of the script, download the TXT version of the script and then delete the ".txt" file extension.
- To use the script, drag and drop a suitable sized image and the text will be placed on the clipboard.
